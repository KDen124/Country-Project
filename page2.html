        <p>Construction of the tower began in 1173 and continued for about 199 years due to the soft ground that caused it to lean. The tower was finally completed in the 14th century. Originally intended as the freestanding campanile (bell tower) of the cathedral in Pisa, the tower leans at about a 4-degree angle. It stands at approximately 56 meters tall.</p>
